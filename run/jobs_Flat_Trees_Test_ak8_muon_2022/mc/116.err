WARNING: In non-interactive mode release checks e.g. deprecated releases, production architectures are disabled.
WARNING: You are trying to use SCRAM architecture 'slc7' on host with operating system 'el9'.
         This is not supported and likely will not work and you might get build/runtime errors. Please either
         - use correct SCRAM_ARCH to match your host's operating system.
         - OR use 'cmssw-el7' script to start a singularity container (http://cms-sw.github.io/singularity.html)
         - OR use host which has 'slc7' installed e.g. lxplus8 for el8, lxplus9 for el9 or lxplus7 for slc7.
